### MONGO DB VS CASSANDRA DB: THE 2â€™S CONSIDERATION


A database is a system designed to store and process data records or files that contains information, such as sales transactions, product information, customer data, business financial(s) with the sole aim of ensuring easy access, management, updating of records by the database user. A database serves as the building block for a more robust framework known as Database Management System (DBMS). According to Techopedia, Database Management System (DBMS) is a system designed to define, manipulate, retrieve and manage data in a database as well as interact with the end-user, back-end, and the application itself to produce information required in a timely and efficient manner. 

In today's business space, the need for an architecture capable of managing, processing, and storing corporate data or client information in a fast and secure manner cannot be overemphasized. Businesses are now migrating from the traditional vehicles of data management which was overwhelmed with several issues and restrictions to a more systematic and automated vehicle for data processing known as Database Management System (DBMS). The ever-increasing need for an effective, efficient, and work-specific data management tool represents an enormous challenge for businesses today as they now have to decide between self-designing a DBMS and adopting the use of a pre-set commercial DBMS.

This article sheds more light on Mongo DB and Cassandra DB, their features/characteristics, qualities, and how they compete in the area of database speed and security.

### MONGO DB AND CASSANDRA DB
#### Mongo DB
 
Designed by Dwight Merriman and Eliot Horowitz in 2007 as a solution to the series of issues faced while using traditional relational databases to Develop Web applications. Mongo DB is a non-structured query language database management program principally used for managing document-oriented information, as well as storing or retrieving such information. It is mostly used in the development of highly available and scalable internet applications and makes use of records made up of documents (a variant called Binary JavaScript Object Notation capable of accommodating more data types) that contains a data structure composed of fields similar to the columns in a relational database and value pairs (a variety of data types arrays of documents).

#### Cassandra DB
 

Just like Mongo DB, Cassandra DB is also an open-source, distributed, wide-column store not structured query language database management program designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers, providing high availability with no single point of failure. Designed initially in 2008, it is a part of the Apache community product line designed to be free, highly editable, and capable of processing a large amount of structured and unstructured data across numerous servers. It is worth noting that Cassandra DB excels at storing time-series data (where old data does not need to be updated) and is proficient at seamlessly responding to data with a high number of queries having similar partition keys.

#### Characteristics and Features
Mongo DB and Cassandra DB interestingly are both from the Non-Structured Query Language family which is a new form of a database. They are designed to promote simpler designs, faster processing as well structure consistency thereby making it different from the relational/traditional database systems which were known to handle storage and retrieval of data in a relational/tabular manner.

Mongo DB and Cassandra DB support real-time analytics and optimized data handling as a result of their ability to process data almost entirely through RAM differing from traditional databases which process data from the hard disk. They are also capable of storing any type of data as well as reducing data queue time through their robust replication features and this gives users the flexibility of creating any number of fields in a document.

Finally, both Mongo DB and Cassandra DB are free, open-source software that permits the user to configure them at no expense. This helps people in the open community to utilize them in the management of data. They also serve as a building block for other features/databases looking to develop a stronger data system.

#### The Speed vs Security Nexus
In today's highly competitive business space known for large chunks of data flying around, companies are pressured to sell to both current and potential customers two notions which are "we prioritize you first" (synonymous to speed) and "you can trust us" (synonymous to security). The responsibility is now on businesses to find a tool capable of solving the two above-mentioned problems in their relations with customers.

For years now, businesses and experts have offered different views and preferences with regards to which of the two problems (Speed and Security) organizations should allocate more resources with regards to procurement of a database capable of meeting customer needs. This represents a huge concern till today because there is still no system capable of satisfying the speed vs security nexus when it comes to database management and this has led companies to adopt a combination of systems which indirectly increases running expense.
Mongo DB vs. Cassandra DB: Speed and Security Comparison
Currently, Mongo DB and Cassandra DB are some of the most used databases in the tech community as their usability cuts across the finance industry as well as the health, technological service, and e-commerce industry. The evaluation of Mongo DB and Cassandra DB in line with the speed and security notion is carried out below;
Speed
While Mongo DB and Cassandra DB offers significant speed advantage over other databases, Cassandra DB is capable of processing all forms of data and can compress up to 80% of data without delay. This serves as a significant advantage over Mongo DB whose over-reliance on a single master node often causes downtime in its data processing.
Security
From research, Cassandra DB slightly beats Mongo DB with regards to security as it is more secure when users want to communicate with the information block/cluster differing from Mongo DB known to be overwhelmed with lots of integrity issues as a result of foreign-key constraints that affect data consistency. It is worth noting that Mongo DB is more open to ransom attacks from malicious hackers than Cassandra DB as a result of the fact that it does not enable user authentication automatically.

#### Conclusion
The purpose of this article is to provide users with foundational knowledge on the applicability of Mongo DB and Cassandra DB in the area of speed and security as standalone database systems. From the writer's perspective, Cassandra DB is a more preferred Database system to Mongo DB as it offers more when it comes to Database speed and security.
